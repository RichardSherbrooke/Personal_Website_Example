<p> Hello! My name is Richard Sherbrooke, welcome to my website. I am a fourth year cognitive science major at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
I am currently studying the foundations of Psychology and Programming in an attempt to become better at coding and eventually land a job as a software engineer. <br>
This is my first attempt at building a website using HTML/CSS, and I am doing the best to test the skills I have learned thus far using W3Schools.com 
<br> <br>
So far, I have experience coding in the following programming languages: <br>
<ul> <li>C++/C#</li> <li>Java</li> <li>MATLAB</li> <li>HTML</li> <li> CSS </li> <li> PHP </li> <li> And I am working on JavaScript </li> 
</ul> <br>


I hope to learn the following languages within the next year:
<ol> <li>Python</li> <li> Swift </li> <li>SQL</li> <li>Ruby</li> </ol> <br>

I also hope that I will be comfortable using GIT repositories, and Github as a platform to share and collaborate on projects. <br>
